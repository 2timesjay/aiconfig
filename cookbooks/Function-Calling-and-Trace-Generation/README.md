# Sequential Function Calling with OpenAI and treating an AIConfig as an execution trace

This notebook extends the other function calling demo (which you should start with first). We start with a mock database of books and functions to list, search, and retrieve books. Function specs are defined straight from python functions using pydantic , and execute the function.
